# Contributing to Are-Self

Welcome. We're building AI infrastructure for the people — especially those who've been left out of the AI revolution. If you believe AI should be a public good and want to help make that real, you're in the right place.

This is an MIT-licensed, neuro-mimetic AI orchestration framework. Every contribution matters, whether you're writing code, documenting features, improving accessibility, or just helping someone else get started.

## Our Mission

Are-Self is designed to make AI accessible to underserved communities — students, educators, nonprofits, churches, anyone who shouldn't need a credit card or a CS degree to use AI. Whether you're a researcher, a developer, or just someone who cares about equitable AI — we want your help.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend work)
- Docker (optional, recommended)

**Quick Setup:**

On Windows, run the included installation script:
```bash
are-self-install.bat
```

For manual setup or other platforms:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scipraxian/are-self.git
cd are-self/are-self-api
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development tools
```

4. Set up the database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create an admin user for testing
```

5. Start Redis (required for Celery):
```bash
redis-server
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 are_self.asgi:application
```

7. In another terminal, start the Celery worker:
```bash
celery -A are_self worker -l info
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Development

The Are-Self UI lives in a separate repository. For fullstack development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scipraxian/are-self-ui.git
cd are-self-ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the are-self-ui repository for its specific setup instructions.

## Code Style Guide

We maintain consistency across the codebase to make it easier for everyone to contribute and review code.

**For complete style guidelines, see [./style-guide](./style-guide)**

Quick reference:
- **Functions:** `snake_case`
- **Classes:** `PascalCase`
- **Logging:** Use `%s` formatting (not f-strings for logging)
- **Line length:** 88 characters maximum
- **Strings:** Single quotes preferred
- **Nested functions:** Avoid them — keep functions at module level for testability

Example:
```python
class NeuronOrchestratorManager:
    """Manages orchestration across neuro-mimetic agents."""

    def coordinate_signal_flow(self, region_id, signal_payload):
        """Route signals between brain regions."""
        logger.info('Routing signal %s to region %s', signal_payload['id'], region_id)
        # Implementation here
```

## Testing

We believe in real tests with real databases.

- Use `CommonFixturesAPITestCase` as your base test class
- Tests run against a real PostgreSQL instance (test database)
- Use `async_to_sync` when testing async code
- Each test should be independent and clean up after itself
- Aim for tests that verify behavior, not implementation details

Example test structure:
```python
from tests.fixtures import CommonFixturesAPITestCase

class HippocampusMemoryTestCase(CommonFixturesAPITestCase):
    """Tests for the Hippocampus (memory) brain region."""

    def test_memory_encoding_and_retrieval(self):
        """Verify memories are encoded and retrievable."""
        memory = self.create_test_memory(content='test')
        retrieved = Memory.objects.get(id=memory.id)
        self.assertEqual(retrieved.content, 'test')
```

Run tests:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-contribution
```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guide above.

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes. All new code should have tests.

4. **Update documentation** if you've changed functionality or added new features.

5. **Run tests locally** to ensure everything passes:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

6. **Push to your fork** and open a pull request against the main repository.

In your PR description, please:
- Describe what problem you're solving or feature you're adding
- Explain *why* this change matters
- Note any new dependencies or environment setup needed
- Reference any related issues with `Closes #123`

Example PR template:
```
## What does this do?
Adds pgvector integration to the Cortex brain region for semantic memory storage.

## Why?
This enables the system to understand semantic relationships between concepts,
improving reasoning across connected neural pathways.

## Testing
Added 8 tests covering vector encoding, similarity search, and edge cases.
All existing tests pass.
```

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Want to suggest a feature? We'd love to hear about it.

**When reporting an issue:**
- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Describe the current behavior and what you expected to happen
- Include steps to reproduce (if it's a bug)
- Share your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
- Include relevant error messages or logs
- Attach screenshots if it's UI-related

**Label your issue:**
- `bug` — Something isn't working as expected
- `feature` — New functionality you'd like to see
- `documentation` — Improvements to docs or guides
- `good first issue` — Great for newcomers
- `help wanted` — We're actively looking for contributions here

## Architecture Overview

Are-Self is built around a neuro-mimetic architecture where **every Django app is a brain region**. This isn't metaphorical — the structure maps to actual brain functions:

- **Hippocampus** — Memory and experience storage
- **Cortex** — Reasoning and semantic understanding
- **Amygdala** — Emotional context and response
- **Cerebellum** — Motor coordination and actions
- And more...

For a deep dive into the architecture, philosophy, and design decisions, see [./architecture](./architecture).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Django 6.x with Daphne ASGI
- **Task Queue:** Celery 5.x with Redis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript (separate repo)
- **LLM Integration:** LiteLLM with support for:
  - Ollama (local deployment)
  - OpenRouter (cloud failover)

## Where We Need Help

We're actively seeking contributions in these areas:

### Testing
- Expanding test coverage for existing brain regions
- Adding integration tests for multi-region workflows
- Performance and stress testing

### Documentation
- Tutorial content for common workflows
- Architecture deep-dives for specific brain regions
- API endpoint documentation
- Deployment guides for different environments

### Tool Development
- Brain region implementations
- LLM provider integrations
- Data import/export tools
- Monitoring and observability tools

### Accessibility
- Ensuring the UI is fully accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Documentation in multiple formats
- Testing with assistive technologies

### Community

- Answer questions in issues and discussions
- Share your projects built with Are-Self

## Code of Conduct

We're building for everyone, and we mean it.

**Be kind.** Assume good intent. We're all learning.

**Be respectful.** Disagree thoughtfully. Different perspectives make us better.

**Be inclusive.** Welcome people from all backgrounds and experience levels. Especially those left out of tech.

**No harassment.** This includes discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, or anything else. We don't tolerate it.

**Lead by example.** The tone we set in code reviews, discussions, and conversations matters.

If you see something that doesn't fit these values, reach out to Michael (scipraxian) directly. We'll address it.
