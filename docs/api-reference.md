# Are-Self API Reference

## Overview

Welcome to the Are-Self API—a neuro-mimetic orchestration framework that mirrors the structure and function of the human brain. Just as the brain organizes information and cognition across specialized regions, Are-Self organizes your AI execution engine around neural regions, each with distinct responsibilities.

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a neuroscience researcher, a computer science student, or someone curious about how artificial intelligence can be structured like a biological brain, this API provides the tools to orchestrate complex reasoning, manage AI identities, schedule iterations, and monitor system-wide health—all through a set of intuitive, brain-inspired endpoints.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:8000`

## Quick Start

### Making Your First API Call

Here's the simplest way to get started with Are-Self. Let's fetch system-wide statistics:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v2/stats/
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "identity_disc_count": 5,
  "ai_model_count": 12,
  "reasoning_session_count": 42
}
```

### Launching a Spike Train

A **spike train** is a reasoning execution—the core unit of work in Are-Self. Here's how to launch one:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/spiketrains/launch/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pathway_id": "my_neural_pathway",
    "identity_disc_id": "my_identity"
  }'
```

**Response (HTTP 201):**
```json
{
  "id": "spike_train_123",
  "status": "running",
  "created_at": "2026-04-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Interacting with a Reasoning Session

If a reasoning session is waiting for human input (in "attention_required" state), inject a message:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/thalamus/interact/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "That analysis looks good, proceed with the next step",
    "identity_disc_id": "my_identity"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Message received",
  "session_id": "reasoning_session_456",
  "turn_number": 3,
  "ok": true
}
```

## Central Nervous System (Execution Engine)

The Central Nervous System is the beating heart of Are-Self. It fires spike trains—discrete reasoning executions—through neural pathways (directed acyclic graphs of neurons and effectors). Think of it as your execution engine: spikes are the signals, neurons are the logic nodes, axons are the connections, and effectors are the actions.

### Spike Trains

Spike trains represent individual reasoning runs. Each spike train traverses a pathway, executing neurons and triggering effectors while maintaining state on a shared blackboard.

## Common Patterns

### Pagination

Most list endpoints support pagination to handle large result sets efficiently.

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit`: Number of records per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- `offset`: Number of records to skip (default: 0)

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/reasoning_sessions/?limit=50&offset=100
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 524,
  "next": "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/reasoning_sessions/?limit=50&offset=150",
  "previous": "http://localhost:8000/api/v2/reasoning_sessions/?limit=50&offset=50",
  "results": [
    { "id": "session_1", "status": "completed" },
    { "id": "session_2", "status": "running" }
  ]
}
```

### Filtering

List endpoints support filtering via query parameters. Common filters include:

- `?status=&#123;value&#125;` — Filter by status (e.g., "running", "completed", "paused")
- `?identity_discs=&#123;id&#125;` — Filter by identity disc
- `?environment=&#123;id&#125;` — Filter by environment
- `?search=&#123;query&#125;` — Full-text search on name/description

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/reasoning_sessions/?status=completed&identity_discs=my_identity
```

### Detail vs. Lightweight Responses

Some endpoints support both lightweight and detailed responses. Use the `?full=true` query parameter or append `/full/` to the path for complete data.

**Example (Lightweight):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/pfc-epics/epic_1/
```

**Example (Full Detail):**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v2/pfc-epics/epic_1/full/
```

### WebSocket Events

Many long-running operations (spike trains, reasoning sessions) emit real-time events via WebSocket. Subscribe to monitor progress:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/v2/spike_train_events/');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log('Spike train event:', data);
};
```

**Common Event Types:**
- `spike_fired` — A neuron or effector executed
- `session_paused` — Reasoning session paused for human input
- `session_resumed` — Reasoning resumed after human input
- `spike_completed` — Spike train finished (success or failure)

### Error Handling

All endpoints follow standard HTTP status codes:

- **200 OK** — Request succeeded
- **201 Created** — Resource created (typically for POST/launch operations)
- **400 Bad Request** — Invalid parameters or malformed request
- **404 Not Found** — Resource does not exist
- **409 Conflict** — Operation conflicts with current state
- **500 Internal Server Error** — Server-side error

**Error Response Format:**
```json
{
  "error": "Invalid spike train ID",
  "details": "Spike train 'missing_id' does not exist",
  "code": "SPIKE_TRAIN_NOT_FOUND"
}
```

### Batch Operations

For bulk updates, POST to list endpoints with an array of objects:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v2/neurons/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[
    { "pathway_id": "path_1", "type": "decision", "name": "Check Status" },
    { "pathway_id": "path_1", "type": "effector", "name": "Send Alert" }
  ]'
```

### State Transitions

Certain resources have state machines. Examples:

- **Spike Train States:** pending → running → completed/failed/stopped
- **Reasoning Session States:** active → attention_required → running → completed
- **Task States:** open → in_progress → closed

State transitions are typically enforced via specific endpoints (e.g., POST `/api/v2/reasoning_sessions/&#123;id&#125;/attention_required/`).
